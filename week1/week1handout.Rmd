# Where to get help outside classes?

- For tech assistance or help with homework: **Course Assistant-led Study Halls**

  >Study halls are a combination of office hours and drop-in tutoring sessions. Course assistants will hold a table usually at one of the house dining halls or common rooms and help students with assignments and course material. Study halls work best if you come as a group and work on the assignments on your own while you are there and ask for help from the CAs when you get stuck.
  
  >Schedule: TBA

- For initial help with course content: ask on course Slack (accessible via Canvas sidebar) or sign up for my office hours

- For perspective and inspiration: sign up for Scott's office hours
